# Final_Project_oliverad
This program is designed to draw a garden on a green grass background.
The program asks the user how many flowers he/she wants. It is suggested
That users enter a number between 1-4 for efficiency purposes (each
flower takes some time to draw).

After the user enters the number of flowers desired, for each flower,
the user will be prompted to enter the x and y coordinate points where
the flower drawing will start. Once that is completed, the user should
choose between each petal made up of triangular (3 sides) or pentagonal
small shapes (5 sides). If the user chose to draw more than one flower,
the questions for the next flower will be asked after the first flower
is drawn.

Once the questions have been answered for all the flowers desired and
the flowers have been drawn, the user can stamp yellow round flower
centers on each flower by clicking in the desired place. And as in any
beautiful garden, butterflies could not be missing. If the user wants
to stamp butterflies, he/she just needs to press b and orange
butterflies will be stamped on random places.

Once the user is happy with their garden, they can quit by pressing q.
